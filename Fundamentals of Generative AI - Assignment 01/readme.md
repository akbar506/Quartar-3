## Differentiate between AI, machine learning, deep learning, generative AI, and applied AI.

**Artificial Intelligence (AI):**
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a vast subject of computer science that tries to build computers that can do activities that would typically need human intelligence. Reasoning, judgment, pattern identification, language comprehension, and other skills are required for these jobs. Artificial intelligence (AI) systems can learn from data or be rule-based, basing judgments on pre-established rules.

**Machine Learning (ML):**
A branch of artificial intelligence called machine learning aims to provide computers the capacity to learn from data and make judgments without needing to be explicitly programmed for every task. ML leverages statistical techniques to allow machines to become more proficient at tasks over time. It covers a range of techniques, including reinforcement learning, unsupervised learning, and supervised learning.

**Deep Learning (DL):**
A branch of machine learning called "deep learning" makes use of multi-layered neural networks (hence the name "deep") to examine different aspects of data. Processing vast volumes of complicated data, including text, voice, and images, is where it excels. A large portion of the feature extraction process is automated using deep learning, which reduces the need for manual human interaction and opens the door to more intricate data interpretations.

**Generative AI:**
The term "generative AI" describes a kind of artificial intelligence that can create new content—text, graphics, and music, among other things—by using data that already exists. It makes use of methods such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). One well-known instance is the employment of language models, such as GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), to produce text that is coherent and appropriate for the context when given a prompt.

**Applied AI:**
The term "applied AI" describes the use of AI technologies to address practical issues in a variety of sectors, including healthcare, banking, the automobile industry, and more. It entails adapting AI and machine learning techniques to real-world use cases, with a stronger emphasis on accomplishing certain objectives like enhancing patient diagnostics, automating driving, or maximizing financial trading.
